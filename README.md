## Overview and Purpose of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis is determine the number of employees  and the positions they occupy at Pewlett Hackard, who can reasonably be expected to retire in the coming 1 to 5 years. In addition, a mentorship program that will give employees nearing retirement the opportunity to train younger colleagues so that they are better prepared to enter leadership positions has been proposed. This analysis includes numbers and names of employees by title, so that feasibility of this program can be determined and recruitment of mentors may begin. 

### Results
*As would be expected, the most senior positions of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff have the most employees who will soon be ready for retirement. Each title has around 25,000 currrent employees coming up on retirement age. 

*At the engineer and staff level, there are fewer employees ready for retirement, but still enough to create disruption and the need for planning. Both titles have  between 7500 and 10000 employees who will soon be eleigible to retire. 

*The more junior positions of Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer and Manager have many fewer retiring employees and will be easier positions to fill with younger staff members.

*Complete numbers are found in the chart below.

Fortunately, the results of the analysis of employees eligible to particpate in the mentoring program are also skewed toward these more senior positions as shown in the bar graph below. However, the descrepancy in numbers of eligible retirees and number of possible mentors for replacements is concerning, and will require planning and attention. 

*At the level of Senior Staff there are about 500 availalbe employees that could qualify to be mentors. This is helpful, but still falls short of the almost 25,00 employees at this level who may be retiring in the coming years. 

*The position of Senior Engineer is even more problematic, with only around 200 eligible mentors for a possible 25,000 openings in the coming years. 

*The Engineer level, with almost 10,000 eligible retirees, has about 460 employees who would be eligible to be mentors in the coming years.

## Summary

Looking at these numbers, it is clear that Pewlett Hackard needs to start preparing for the coming wave of retirement that is almost certainly inevitable in the coming years. The mentorhip program is feasible, with plenty of eligible mentors who could be offered a role in the program and may help prepare some replacements for these leadership positions. However, even with this program, replacement from within will clearly fall far short of the numbers that are required. PH will need to do some intensive, targeted recruitment over the coming year or two, to begin to replace this workforce. They may also decide to look at their numbers and efficiency and decide if more can be done with fewer employees in the future.
